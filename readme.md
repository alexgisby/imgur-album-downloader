# imgur Album Downloader

This is a simple Python script that contains a class and command line interface that
allows you to download ann images at full resolution in an imgur album, all at once.

## jtara1 Fork - Features
Features added:

* supports imgur images that aren't "gallery" or "a" or "album" e.g.:

>http://imgur.com/SnkkAVU

>http://i.imgur.com/SnkkAVU.png

* uses album/gallery/image title as folder title that's created and contains image(s) with key appended e.g.:

>We don't have a blue backdrop, just tint the whole photo blue. (SnkkAVU)

* __init__ function of ImgurAlbumDownloader now takes an 2nd (optional) parameter, dir_download which allows for specific directory to download to (not adapted for cli), e.g.:

>downloader = ImgurAlbumDownloader('http://imgur.com/SnkkAVU', '/home/user/Downloads/')

## Requirements

Python >= 3.3

## Command Line Usage

	$ python3 imguralbum.py [album URL] [folder to save to]

Download all images from an album into the folder /Users/alex/images/downloaded

	$ python3 imguralbum.py http://imgur.com/a/uOOju /Users/alex/images/downloaded
	
Downloads all images and puts them into an album in the current directory called "uOOju"

	$ python3 imguralbum.py http://imgur.com/a/uOOju


## Class Usage

The class allows you to download imgur albums in your own Python programs without going
through the command line. Here's an example of it's usage:

### Example:
	downloader = ImgurAlbumDownloader("http://imgur.com/a/uOOju")
	print "This albums has %d images" % downloader.num_images()
	downloader.save_images()

### Callbacks:
You can hook into the classes process through a couple of callbacks:
	
	downloader.on_image_download()
	downloader.on_complete()

You can see what params and such your callback functions get by looking at the docblocks
for the on_XXX functions in the .py file.

## Full docs:

The whole shebang, class and CLI is fully documented using string-docblock things in the single .py file
so please read through that rather than rely on this readme which could drift out of date.
